Distance for binary data:
Binary ecludean distance
Simple matching coefficient
Jaccard's coefficients.

If the datapoints are equi-distance then it will take one but not two

Coding:
Load
Normalize the data: either z or if we have categorial x-min/max-min etc.
Find euclidean or any relevant distance
do hclust
Find k value and divide into groups
Attach these groups with actual data

Tips&tricks:
Using dendogram, we can comment on what datapoints are clustered first. By checking the heights
Clustering is not suited for larger datasets.

Queries:
Sir in regression, we can call it a best model based on accuracy. Do we have any such measure here sir? Or else how do we say our clustering is best when compared to others - Balance
